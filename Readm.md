# About PHOCccccc

Phocyyyyy is an AI-powered color transfer application that allows you to apply color styles between images and videos using server-side processing. The app is designed to make color styling simple, fast, and accessible with just a single click.

In addition to color style transfer, Phocyyyyy also provides color enhancement tools that allow you to adjust and refine your results, such as Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Hue, Temperature, and Tint.

All processing is performed through secure AI-powered systems to deliver consistent results while preserving the original structure and visual quality of your media.

# How to Use PHOC

Wait while your media is securely processed on the server.

After processing, you can fine-tune the result using the color enhancement tools such as:

Brightness

Use the Undo and Redo buttons to revert or reapply changes while editing.

# Internet Requirement


Phocyyyyy uses AI-powered server-side processing to deliver high-quality color transfer, color style transformation, and color enhancement results. An active internet connection is required to upload selected media files to the server and receive the processed output.

AI-based features of the app cannot function without an internet connection.

# Permissions

Phocyyyyy requires access to your device’s media storage so that you can select images and videos for color transfer and editing.

Internet permission is required to securely upload selected media files for AI-powered server-side processing and to receive the processed results.


# Saving Results


Once processing is complete, you can download the final image or video directly to your device using the Download button.

Downloaded files are saved to your device’s local storage and are accessible from your gallery or file manager. The app does not automatically share your media with any third party.

You have full control over your downloaded content, and you may delete it from your device at any time.

# Common Issues & Troubleshooting

Common Issues & Troubleshooting

Processing takes more time than usual
Processing time depends on file size, video length, and your internet speed. Larger files or longer videos may take a few extra seconds.

Slow or no response from the app
Please make sure you have a stable and active internet connection. Server-side AI processing requires a good network connection.

Large images take time to load
High-resolution images may take a moment to load on the editing screen. This is normal behavior.

Download button not responding
Wait until processing is fully completed. Try again once the result is displayed.

App feels slow or laggy
Close other background apps and ensure your device has enough free storage and memory.

Output quality not as expected
Results depend on the quality, lighting, and colors of the source and target media. Try using clearer images or videos for better results.

Video processing takes longer than images
Videos are larger in size and require more server resources, so they naturally take more time to process.

If the issue continues, please restart the app and check your internet connection.
